# Easy Mixology

A highly customizable plugin to improve experience inside mastering mixology minigame!

As the plugin (and the minigame) are quite fresh, you may encounter issues. Please report them to me, so I can iron these knicks out. 

Note: Currently the plugin assumes the player starts with a mix from scratch when entering, and does not consider any potions in the inventory. This is being worked on.
